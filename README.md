Welcome to my PC Game Suggestor! Here's how you make it work to the best of it's ability.

This application does the following: 
    -Calls from an external, third party API (RAWG API) to randomly provide users with one game available. Steps through objects and arrays provided by the API at random to select image art and the name of a game only if the game is available to play on the PC.

    -Allows a user to continually press a button to cycle through the PC games provided.

    -Utilizes local API created by me through Express.js to obtain and display a list of quotes at random to be displayed whenever a user visits the page. In order to use this, please follow the instructions below:


1) Install nodejs and npm. Make sure they are updated them if you already have them
2) Run "npm start"
